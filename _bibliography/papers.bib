  abstract={As the global population ages, effective rehabilitation and mobility aids will become increasingly critical. Gait assistive robots are promising solutions, but designing adaptable controllers for various impairments poses a significant challenge. This paper presented a Human-In-The-Loop (HITL) simulation framework tailored specifically for gait assistive robots, addressing unique challenges posed by passive support systems. We incorporated a realistic physical human-robot interaction (pHRI) model to enable a quantitative evaluation of robot control strategies, highlighting the performance of a speedadaptive controller compared to a conventional PID controller in maintaining compliance and reducing gait distortion. We assessed the accuracy of the simulated interactions against that of the real-world data and revealed discrepancies in the adaptation strategies taken by the human and their effect on the human’s gait. This work underscored the potential of HITL simulation as a versatile tool for developing and fine-tuning personalized control policies for various users.}

  abstract={Ensuring safe and comfortable bite transfer during robot-assisted feeding is challenging due to the close physical human-robot interaction required. This paper presents a novel approach to modeling physical human-robot interaction in a physics-based simulator (MuJoCo) using soft-body dynamics. We integrate a flexible head model with a rigid skeleton while accounting for internal dynamics, enabling the flexible model to be actuated by the skeleton. Incorporating realistic soft-skin contact dynamics in simulation allows for systematically evaluating bite transfer parameters, such as insertion depth and entry angle, and their impact on user safety and comfort. Our findings suggest that a straight-in-straight-out strategy minimizes forces and enhances user comfort in robot-assisted feeding, assuming a static head. This simulation-based approach offers a safer and more controlled alternative to real-world experimentation.}

  abstract={Numerous diseases and aging can cause degeneration of people’s balance ability resulting in limited mobility and even high risks of fall. Robotic technologies can provide more intensive rehabilitation exercises or be used as assistive devices to compensate for balance ability. However, With the new healthcare paradigm shifting from hospital care to home care, there is a gap in robotic systems that can provide care at home. This paper introduces Mobile Robotic Balance Assistant (MRBA), a compact and cost-effective balance assistive robot that can provide both rehabilitation training and activities of daily living (ADLs) assistance at home. A three degrees of freedom (3-DoF) robotic arm was designed to mimic the therapist arm function to provide balance assistance to the user. To minimize the interference to users’ natural pelvis movements and gait patterns, the robot must have a Human-Robot Interface(HRI) that can detect user intention accurately and follow the user’s movement smoothly and timely. Thus, a graceful user following control rule was proposed. The overall control architecture consists of two parts: an observer for human inputs estimation and an LQR-based controller with disturbance rejection. The proposed controller is validated in high-fidelity simulation with actual human trajectories, and the results successfully show the effectiveness of the method in different walking modes.}
