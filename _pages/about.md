I am a final year Ph.D student at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore, under the supervision of Prof. <a href='https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/entities/person/Ang-Wei-Tech'>Ang Wei Tech</a>. I received my B.S. and M.S. degrees in Mechanical Engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong Univeristy (<a href='https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/'>SJTU</a>) and National University of Singapore (<a href='https://www.nus.edu.sg/'>NUS</a>), respectively. My research interests lie in assistive robotics, human-robot interaction, human-in-the-loop simulation, and effective Sim2Real transfer for safe and personalized assistive strategies.

My current research focuses on developing intelligent assistive robots and personalized strategies for individuals with gait and balance impairments. Central to my work is the creation of a Real2Sim2Real framework that integrates digital twins of both humans and robots. This framework enables accurate modeling of user-robot interactions and co-adaptation, facilitating rapid design iterations through simulation and enabling personalization of assistive strategies based on realistic human behavior.

With a strong foundation in both hardware and software aspects of robotics, I bring a multidisciplinary approach to solving complex, real-world challenges in assistive technology. Feel free to reach out for potential collaboration or discussion.
